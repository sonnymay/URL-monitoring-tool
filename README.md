# URL Monitoring Tool

This is a simple URL monitoring tool that periodically checks the status of a given URL and notifies you if there are any changes or issues. It is written in Python and uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

To get started with the URL monitoring tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/url-monitoring-tool.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:

```shell
$ pip install requests
```

3. Open the `monitor.py` file and customize it to your needs. You can modify the URL to monitor and the check interval:

```python
url_to_monitor = "https://example.com"
check_interval = 60  # seconds
```

4. Run the `monitor.py` script:

```shell
$ python monitor.py
```

The script will start monitoring the specified URL and print the status to the console. You can add your own notification logic in the `monitor_url` function to receive alerts when the URL is not accessible.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the URL monitoring tool to suit your requirements. Here are a few suggestions:

- Add more advanced error handling to handle specific types of exceptions.
- Implement different notification methods such as sending emails or push notifications.
- Store the monitoring results in a database or log file for further analysis.
